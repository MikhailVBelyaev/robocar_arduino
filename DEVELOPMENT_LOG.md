# Arduino Robocar Development Log

## ðŸ“… 2025-05-01

### âœ… Tasks Completed
- Set up Arduino Nano R4 with Wi-Fi for local network communication
- Configured HTTP endpoints for movement control:
  - **`/forward`** â€“ Move forward
  - **`/back`** â€“ Move backward
  - **`/left`** â€“ Turn left
  - **`/right`** â€“ Turn right
  - **`/scan`** â€“ Initial room scan
- Created Python script (`room_scanner.py`) to handle HTTP requests and room scanning logic
- The car can move based on simple HTTP commands sent via the local network
- Implemented basic room scanning logic, using the ultrasonic sensor for distance measurements
- Estimated area after initial scan: 52mÂ² (which is incorrect due to poor estimation logic)

### ðŸ§ª Results
- The car successfully responds to movement commands via the HTTP interface.
- The scan is being performed, but the area calculation needs to be more accurate. The current logic uses a rough estimation which overestimates the room size.
- The car is able to navigate the room but needs refinement in its decision-making and obstacle avoidance.

### ðŸ§­ Plan for 2025-05-02
- Improve room area estimation logic to match the actual room size more accurately (e.g., account for obstacles like tables and machines).
- Add functionality to move the car between rooms or stop when the scan completes.
- Continue working on fine-tuning the scanning logic (e.g., handle various room configurations).
- Integrate potential improvements for error handling in the room scanning process.
- Review the Python script and identify areas for optimization.

### ðŸ¤– Prompt for Next Session
> Improve room scanning logic and refine area estimation to more accurately represent the physical space. Develop error handling and further optimize the movement logic. Ensure that the car stops at the end of its scan and doesn't overestimate the room size.
